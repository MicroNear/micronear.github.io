    By adding a micronation, the micronation data will be sent to the server.
    The micronation data consists of the "Add a micronation" form and geolocation data determined by the device used to add the micronation.
    The server will store the micronation data and provide it to the users.
    By switching on the "Visible on map" switch, users will be able to see precise geolocation of the micronation on map.
    By switching on the "Show distance from users" switch, some users will be able to see their distance from the micronation.
    By checking the "I agree to the terms of service" checkbox, the user declares that they agree with the Terms of Service.
