    By switching on the "Visible on map" switch, users will be able to see precise geolocation of the micronation on map.
    By switching on the "Show distance from users" switch, some users will be able to see their distance from the micronation.
    By checking the "I agree to the Privacy Policy" checkbox, the user declares that they agree with the Privacy Policy.
