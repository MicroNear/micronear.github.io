<h4> Adding a micronation </h4>
<p>
    By adding a micronation, the micronation data will become accessible to the public.
    The micronation data consists of the "Add a micronation" form and geolocation data determined by the device used to add the micronation.
    By switching on the "Visible on map" switch, users will be able to see precise geolocation of the micronation on map.
    By switching on the "Show distance from users" switch, some users will be able to see their distance from the micronation.
    By checking the "I agree to the terms of service" checkbox, the user declares that they agree with the Privacy Policy.
<h4> Micronations nearby </h4>
<p>
    The server will process geolocation data determined by the device used in order to find micronations near to the user.
    Micronation owners do not have access to any statistics nor user data.
</p>

<h4> Removing your data </h4>
<p>
    Micronations will be removable from the micronation settings page.
